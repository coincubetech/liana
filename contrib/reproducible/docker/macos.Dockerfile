# NOTE: we were previously caching dependencies here (through `cargo vendor`). It's a tradeoff between the image size
# and not needing internet access when running the image to build the software.

# For some reason, we can't just set the RUSTFLAGS environment variable to add `-L` for compiling dependencies.
# This doesn't work: RUSTFLAGS="-L/liana/rust-1.70.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/rust-std-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/"
# As a workaround, we use a wrapped `rustc` binary that always links against the macOS stdlib we just downloaded.
