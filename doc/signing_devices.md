# Signing devices

Documentation related to signing devices. For now only Specter and Ledger are supported since we
need signers to support Miniscript descriptors.

The connection to the signing devices is implemented in [another
repository](https://github.com/wizardsardine/async-hwi).


## Specter

[Specter DIY](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-diy) version v1.5.0 and above is supported.

## Ledger

Minimum supported version of the Bitcoin application is 2.1.0 (the first version to have  full
Miniscript descriptors support).
