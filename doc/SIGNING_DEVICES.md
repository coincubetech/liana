WARNING: You won't be able to connect your Jade to Liana if you choose "QrCode" mode when setting up
your Jade. This is because in this mode the Jade refuses to communicate through USB.

WARNING: the network cannot be changed after setting up the device without a factory reset. The
network is set at the same time as the PIN.

It is sometimes useful to change the network without a factory reset, such as when testing the
device and/or Liana. In this case the "Temporary signer" mode may be used. The network can be reset
by simply disconnecting and reconnecting it. If using this mode, we advise you to first choose the
network in the Liana installer before setting up the network on your Jade.
